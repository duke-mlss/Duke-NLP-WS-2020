    "However, if we assume there is more than one layer, it is more common to refer to the intermediate representation as $h$.\n",
    "Note that we also use $f()$ to denote a nonlinear activation function.\n",
    "In the past, we've seen $f()$ as a $\\text{ReLU}$, but this could also be a $\\sigma()$ or $\\tanh()$ nonlinearity.\n",

    "<img src=\"Figures/rnn_mlp.PNG\" width=\"175\"/>\n",

    "The key thing to notice here is that we project the input $x$ with a linear transformation (with $W$ and $b$), and then apply a nonlinearity to the output, giving us $h$.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### A basic RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the previous examples we've seen using fully connected layers, sequential data have multiple inputs $x_1, ..., x_T$, instead of a single $x$.\n",
    "We need to adapt our models accordingly for an RNN.\n",
    "While there are several variations, a common basic formulation for an RNN is the Elman RNN, which is as follows&ast;:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "h_t = \\tanh((x_t W_x + b_x) + (h_{t-1} W_h + b_h))\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tanh()$ is the hyperbolic tangent, a nonlinear activation function.\n",
    "RNNs process words one at a time in sequence ($x_t$), producing a hidden state $h_t$ at every time step.\n",
    "The first half of the above equation should look familiar; as with the fully connected layer, we are linearly transforming each input $x_t$, and then applying a nonlinearity.\n",
    "Notice that we apply the same linear transformation ($W_x$, $b_x$) at every time step.\n",
    "The difference is that we also apply a separate linear transform ($W_h$, $b_h$) to the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ and add it to our projected input.\n",
    "This feedback is called a *recurrent* connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "These directed cycles in the RNN architecture gives them the ability to model temporal dynamics, making them particularly suited for modeling sequences (e.g. text).\n",
    "We can visualize an RNN layer as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures/rnn.PNG\" width=\"350\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can unroll an RNN through time, making the sequential nature of them more obvious:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures/rnn_unrolled.PNG\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of these recurrent connections as allowing the model to consider previous hidden states of a sequence when calculating the hidden state for the current input.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"1\">&ast;Note: We don't actually need two separate biases $b_x$ and $b_h$, as you can combine both biases into a single learnable parameter $b$. \n",
    "However, writing it separately helps make it clear that we're performing a linear transformation on both $x_t$ and $h_{t-1}$.\n",
    "Speaking of combining variables, we can also express the above operation by concatenating $x_t$ and $h_{t-1}$ into a single vector $z_t$, and then performing a single matrix multiply $z_t W_z + b$, where $W_z$ is essentially $W_x$ and $W_h$ concatenated.\n",
    "Indeed this is how many \"official\" RNNs modules are implemented, as the reduction in the number of separate matrix multiply operations makes it computationally more effecient.\n",
    "These are implementation details though.</font>\n",
