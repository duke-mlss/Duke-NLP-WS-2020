    "So far, we've primarily been building neural networks with fairy basic PyTorch operations.\n",

    "This can be important as you're learning concepts and the various frameworks, and sometimes the low-level control is necessary if you're trying to build something novel.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most of the time, we do find ourselves repeating the same fairly standard lines of code, which can slow us down. \n",
    "Worse, it clutters up our code unnecessarily and introduces room for bugs and typos.\n",
    "And finally, as researchers or engineers, we would like to spend most of our time thinking on the highest levels of abstractions: I want to add a convolution layer here, then a fully-connected there, etc.\n",
    "Having to code all the small details are distractions that can detract from our ability to translate ideas into code.\n",
